Current retry logic retries forever without considering overall system health.\n\nCircuit breaker states:\n- Closed: Normal operation, requests pass through\n- Open: Failure threshold exceeded, requests fail fast\n- Half-Open: Testing if service recovered\n\nConfiguration per endpoint:\n- failure_threshold: 5 errors in 60s to open\n- reset_timeout: 30s before half-open test\n- half_open_requests: 1 test request allowed\n\nBenefits:\n- Fast fail during outages (better UX than hanging)\n- Prevents overwhelming struggling Splunk instances\n- Automatic recovery detection\n- Metrics for circuit state changes\n\nImplementation wraps the client with circuit breaker middleware using failsafe or custom implementation.",
