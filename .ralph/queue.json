Current tests are example-based and may miss edge cases like empty collections, maximum values, or malformed input.\n\nTarget areas:\n- Pagination logic (offset/count bounds, has_next calculation)\n- Serde serialization/deserialization roundtrips\n- Date/time parsing edge cases\n- URL encoding/query parameter generation\n- Response parsing with varying field presence\n\nProperty-based tests generate hundreds of random inputs to find edge cases that human-written tests miss. This improves reliability and catches regressions in data handling.",
