This is a security risk for shared systems or backup exposure.\n\nEncryption features:\n- AES-256-GCM encryption of sensitive fields\n- Argon2id key derivation from user password\n- Keyring integration for passwordless operation (store encryption key in OS keychain)\n- Automatic encryption detection and migration\n- CLI commands for encrypt/decrypt/rotate-key\n\nFields encrypted:\n- api_token\n- password\n- session tokens\n\nImplementation uses ring or aes-gcm crates. Master key can be:\n1. Derived from user-provided password\n2. Random key stored in OS keyring (default)\n3. Environment variable for CI/CD\n\nCritical for enterprise security requirements.",
