      "title": "Refactor SplunkClient to allow concurrent API calls (remove TUI mutex bottleneck)",
      "description": "Opportunity type: performance / strategic refactor\n\nEvidence:\n- The TUI side-effects layer documents that all API calls are serialized behind a single `Arc<Mutex<SplunkClient>>` because client methods require `&mut self` for session refresh (`crates/tui/src/runtime/side_effects/mod.rs`).\n- CLI `list-all` explicitly fetches resources sequentially for the same reason (`crates/cli/src/commands/list_all/fetchers.rs`).\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Serialized calls increase perceived latency (slow screen loads, slow multi-resource commands) and increase the chance that background refreshes starve user-triggered actions.\n- Making the client concurrency-friendly unlocks parallel health aggregation, faster list-all, and smoother TUI refresh behavior.\n\nProposed approach:\n- Minimal viable slice:\n  - Refactor auth/session token refresh to use interior mutability so request methods can be `&self` (e.g., session manager behind an async lock with a singleflight refresh path).\n  - Update the client API surface accordingly and remove the global mutex in TUI (`Arc<SplunkClient>` instead of `Arc<Mutex<...>>`).\n  - Introduce a concurrency limit (semaphore) at the UI edge to prevent flooding Splunk.\n- Expansion:\n  - Parallelize multi-call aggregations (health aggregate, list-all resources) using `join!` with bounded concurrency.\n\nRisks and mitigations:\n- Risk: race conditions around token refresh. Mitigation: singleflight refresh with strict invariants and tests for concurrent callers.\n- Risk: wide blast radius (signature changes). Mitigation: staged refactor with clear compilation gates and workspace-wide updates.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- New tests covering concurrent token refresh behavior and ensuring correctness for both API-token and session-token auth.\n- Demonstrable latency reduction for health aggregation and list-all (documented benchmark or measured in a test/bench).\n- `make test` and `make ci` pass.\n\nPriority rationale:\n- Medium: hig...",
