There is no create/delete or enable/disable command surface.\n- TUI Saved Searches screen supports run/edit/export, but not create/delete or enable/disable (keybindings in README).\n- The client already has `create_saved_search`, `delete_saved_search`, and `update_saved_search(..., disabled)` (`crates/client/src/client/search.rs`).\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Saves time by enabling full lifecycle management from the terminal: create -> iterate -> disable/enable -> delete.\n- Reduces reliance on Splunk Web for routine knowledge-object management.\n\nProposed approach:\n- Minimal slice:\n  - CLI: add `splunk-cli saved-searches create <NAME> --search <SPL>` and `delete <NAME> [--force]`, plus `enable/disable <NAME>` wrappers.\n  - TUI: add `n` (new), `d` (delete with confirmation), and `t` (toggle disabled) on Saved Searches screen using the existing popup/action patterns.\n- Expansion: add namespace flags (`--app`, `--owner`) if supported by endpoints; add schedule editing as a later phase.\n\nRisks and mitigations:\n- Risk: destructive operations. Mitigation: confirmations + `--force` in CLI, confirm modal in TUI, and clear error messaging.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- CLI help updated with examples; error messages match repo conventions.\n- Hermetic tests cover arg parsing and non-network failure modes; ignored live tests cover success paths.\n- TUI keybindings docs are regenerated and reflect new actions.\n- `make test` passes.\n\nPriority rationale:\n- High: closes a real end-to-end workflow gap using existing client capabilities.",

Being able to fetch results without re-running the search improves incident response and automation.\n\nProposed approach:\n- Minimal slice: add `splunk-cli jobs results <SID> [--count N] [--offset N] [-o json|table|csv|xml] [--output-file PATH]` that calls `get_search_results` and formats results via existing search result formatter.\n- Expansion: add `--all` to iterate pages until completion and stream to stdout/file; add `jobs events` later if needed.\n\nRisks and mitigations:\n- Risk: large outputs. Mitigation: default to a safe count; document `--output-file`; consider NDJSON streaming as a follow-up.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- CLI help includes examples and documents pagination flags.\n- Hermetic tests cover arg parsing and formatting glue; ignored live tests validate server behavior.\n- `make test` passes.\n\nPriority rationale:\n- Medium: meaningful workflow unlock with moderate effort.",

      "description": "Opportunity type: performance / strategic refactor\n\nEvidence:\n- The TUI side-effects layer documents that all API calls are serialized behind a single `Arc<Mutex<SplunkClient>>` because client methods require `&mut self` for session refresh (`crates/tui/src/runtime/side_effects/mod.rs`).\n- CLI `list-all` explicitly fetches resources sequentially for the same reason (`crates/cli/src/commands/list_all/fetchers.rs`).\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Serialized calls increase perceived latency (slow screen loads, slow multi-resource commands) and increase the chance that background refreshes starve user-triggered actions.\n- Making the client concurrency-friendly unlocks parallel health aggregation, faster list-all, and smoother TUI refresh behavior.\n\nProposed approach:\n- Minimal viable slice:\n  - Refactor auth/session token refresh to use interior mutability so request methods can be `&self` (e.g., session manager behind an async lock with a singleflight refresh path).\n  - Update the client API surface accordingly and remove the global mutex in TUI (`Arc<SplunkClient>` instead of `Arc<Mutex<...>>`).\n  - Introduce a concurrency limit (semaphore) at the UI edge to prevent flooding Splunk.\n- Expansion:\n  - Parallelize multi-call aggregations (health aggregate, list-all resources) using `join!` with bounded concurrency.\n\nRisks and mitigations:\n- Risk: race conditions around token refresh. Mitigation: singleflight refresh with strict invariants and tests for concurrent callers.\n- Risk: wide blast radius (signature changes). Mitigation: staged refactor with clear compilation gates and workspace-wide updates.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- New tests covering concurrent token refresh behavior and ensuring correctness for both API-token and session-token auth.\n- Demonstrable latency reduction for health aggregation and list-all (documented benchmark or measured in a test/bench).\n- `make test` and `make ci` pass.\n\nPriority rationale:\n- Medium: hig...",
